## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: Python is called high-level programming language because we/users code everything in normal english language using some syntax

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans: Python is called dynamically typed language because the interpretor assigns a datatype at runtime based on the variable's value at the time. No need to specify datatype externally

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans: Pros:
		1. Robust
		2. Easy to learn
		3. Huge support from community
		4. Open source 
	 Cons:
		1. Runtime errors
		2. Slow speed
		3. Not memory efficient
		4. Database access

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans: 1. High end application
	 2. Web Applications
	 3. Data Science
	 4. Enterprise Applications
	 
	 
Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans: Variables are unique special names given to a particular memory location to identify them individually

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans: By using input() function

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans: Default Datatype for input value is string

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Externally/Forcefully changing the datatype of a variable

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: No, we can not take multiple inputs using single input() from user as the input is given in a variable which will accept only once, but we can give a huge length input as single input

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: Keywords are the pre-defined words in python, which can not be used as variables

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: No, we can not use a keyword as variable. Because the interpretor thinks the variable as the keyword and throw us as error

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans: Indentation is the space in python, it is very much used in If-Else statements, switch cases etc etc

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans: By using print() function

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans: Operators are the mathematical/arthematical, logical, comparison which perform certain operations while used

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans: / - Division result will be in float value
	 // - Integral Division result will be in the integer value

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans: print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron")

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans: number = int(input("Enter the number : "))
	if (number % 2 == 0):
		print("Number is even")
	else:
		print("Number is odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans: Boolean operators are the operators which gives result as true or false based on the conditions

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```
Ans: 1 or 0 -> 1
	 0 and 0 -> 0
	 True and False and True -> False
	 1 or 0 or 0 -> 1

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans: Conditional statements are the statements which check for the conditions and give the output accordingly

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans: if, elif, else are the conditions statements used to check the conditions
			- if : if only one condition with no mandatory else function
			- elif : if there are many conditions
			- else : if one or more conditions are present, else is mandatory
		
Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans: age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
	 if (age >= 18):
		print("I can vote")
	 else:
		print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans:

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum = 0

for i in range(7):
    if numbers[i]%2 == 0:
        sum = sum + numbers[i]
print(sum)

print("Sum of Even Numbers is", sum)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans: a = int(input("Enter the value of a"))
	 b = int(input("Enter the value of b"))
	 c = int(input("Enter the value of c"))
	 if (a>b>c):
		print("a is greatest")
	 elif (b>a>c):
		print("b is greatest")
	 else:
		print("c is greatest")

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans= numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in range(6):
    if (numbers[i] % 5 == 0):
        if (numbers[i] > 150):
            numbers[i] = numbers[i+1]
        print(numbers[i])
        if (numbers[i] > 500):
            break
