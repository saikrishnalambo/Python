## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: Python is called high-level programming language because we/users code everything in normal english language using some syntax

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans: Python is called dynamically typed language because the interpretor assigns a datatype at runtime based on the variable's value at the time. No need to specify datatype externally

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

		1. Robust
		2. Easy to learn
		3. Huge support from community

Ans: Default Datatype for input value is string

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Externally/Forcefully changing the datatype of a variable

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: No, we can not take multiple inputs using single input() from user as the input is given in a variable which will accept only once, but we can give a huge length input as single input

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: Keywords are the pre-defined words in python, which can not be used as variables

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: No, we can not use a keyword as variable. Because the interpretor thinks the variable as the keyword and throw us as error

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans: if, elif, else are the conditions statements used to check the conditions
			- if : if only one condition with no mandatory else function
			- elif : if there are many conditions
			- else : if one or more conditions are present, else is mandatory
